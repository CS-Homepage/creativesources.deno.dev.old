# Creative Sources Homepage

This repo is the private Master branch of https://creativesources.deno.dev, later to become https://creativesources.io. I need help:
1. How do we put Master on Main later?
2. Nano JSX is cool. But better preact/ Fresh?
3. Next issue is state. What path to take?

INSTALLATION:
1. Please clone repo for local use, with latest Deno and VS Code Deno extension installed (on Arch Linux).
2. $ deno bundle ./islands/index.tsx ./islands/bundle.js again if you want to.
3. $ deno task start
4. Access website on localhost:60999

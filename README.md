# Creative Sources Homepage with Nano JSX

This repo is a demonstration what you can do with just Deno and Nano JSX. I think it blew up the Deno V8 engine...

1. Please clone repo for local use, with latest Deno and VS Code Deno extension installed (on Arch Linux).
2. Get the missing files fom .gitignore
3. $ deno bundle ./islands/index.tsx ./islands/bundle.js again if you want to.
4. $ deno task start
5. Access website on localhost:60999
6. Please star this repository.
